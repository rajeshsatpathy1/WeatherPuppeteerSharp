# TodoApi

## Overview
The `TodoApi` project is a sample ASP.NET Core Web API application that demonstrates the use of PuppeteerSharp for browser automation. The `WeatherForecastController` provides endpoints for generating weather forecasts and testing PuppeteerSharp functionality.

## Endpoints

### 1. `GetWeatherForecast`
- **Route**: `/WeatherForecast/GetWeatherForecast`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Description**: Returns a list of weather forecasts with random temperature and summary values.

### 2. `PostWeatherForecast`
- **Route**: `/WeatherForecast/PostWeatherForecast`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Description**: Returns a list of weather forecasts with random temperature and summary values, similar to `GetWeatherForecast` but with a different summary suffix.

### 3. `PuppeteerSharpTest`
- **Route**: `/WeatherForecast/PuppeteerSharpTest`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Description**: 
  - Demonstrates PuppeteerSharp's ability to automate browser actions.
  - Sets a cookie and intercepts requests to modify payloads.
  - Navigates to the `PostWeatherForecast` endpoint and generates a PDF of the page.

### 4. `PuppeteerSharpCustomTest`
- **Route**: `/WeatherForecast/PuppeteerSharpCustomTest`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Description**: 
  - Demonstrates advanced PuppeteerSharp usage with custom Chrome arguments and executable path.
  - Renders a simple HTML page, retrieves its content, and generates a PDF file as a response.

## PuppeteerSharp Integration
The project uses PuppeteerSharp to automate browser interactions. Key features include:
- Setting cookies.
- Intercepting and modifying HTTP requests.
- Generating PDFs from web pages.
- Using custom Chrome configurations for advanced scenarios.

## Prerequisites
- .NET 6.0 or later.
- PuppeteerSharp library.
- Chrome executable for custom PuppeteerSharp tests.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Restore NuGet packages.
3. Build and run the project.
4. Use tools like Postman or a browser to test the endpoints.

## Output
- PDFs generated by PuppeteerSharp are saved in the `output` directory or returned as responses.

## Notes
- Ensure the Chrome executable path is correctly set in the `PuppeteerSharpCustomTest` method.
- Modify the `launcherArgs` array in `PuppeteerSharpCustomTest` as needed for your environment.
